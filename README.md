This webpage is powered by React.


Here you can find an introduction about myself and links to my projects, so I will add more projects from time to time!

I hope you like this 90s inspired site. ðŸ•º

## Structure

The webpage has a simple structure, with a fixed menu, a hero and 3 sections: about, projects, contact, and finally, a footer.

My favorite part is the tiny bot. Have you spoken to her?
